# TODO
-Theme the "greyed out" view of disabled preferences (it isn't very visible right now)
-Fix main screen layout such that it expands or gets smaller according to screen size (would also make it work in landscape)
-Refactor styles xml and possibly colors xml so that they are better organized/labelled and more compatible with everything
-Add in-app purchase to unlock premium category permanently
-Refactor preferences code to reduce dependence on 3rd party libraries
-Add background themeing (maybe)
