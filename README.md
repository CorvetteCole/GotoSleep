# GotoSleep

# TODO
-Add notifications with varying defualt non-vulgar go to sleep reminders and also some default vulgar reminders.

-Notification amount setting should be changed to a menu with 1, 3, and 5 as options. Notification delay can remain a seekbar

-Add ability to customize sleep reminders in premium options.

-Fix main screen stars and moon so that they scale properly with device display size changes.
Possibly make a separate layout and set that as the background of content_main? Either way, needs fixing.

-Refactor styles xml and possibly colors xml so that they are better organized/labelled and more compatible with everything

-Add in-app purchase to unlock premium category permanently

-Add icon credits for app icon, intro icons

-AMOLED black theme

-Make app notifications have a background color that matches the app background color (AMOLED black or
just the normal black). Use setColorized(true) and setColor(int) on Android Oreo+. Figure out how to do it on Android
versions prior to Oreo (or only include it as an Oreo feature).

-Refactor preferences code to reduce dependence on 3rd party libraries

-Add background themeing (maybe)
