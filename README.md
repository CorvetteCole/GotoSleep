# TODO
-Fix main screen stars and moon so that they scale properly with device display size changes.
Possibly make a separate layout and set that as the background of content_main? Either way, needs fixing.

-Refactor styles xml and possibly colors xml so that they are better organized/labelled and more compatible with everything

-Add in-app purchase to unlock premium category permanently

-Add icon credits for app icon, intro icons

-Tap on main screen to hide/unhide buttons

-AMOLED black theme

-Refactor preferences code to reduce dependence on 3rd party libraries

-Add background themeing (maybe)
